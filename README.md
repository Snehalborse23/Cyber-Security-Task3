**Password Complexity Checker**
**Organization:** Comillas Negras | **Internship:** Prodigy Infotech  

This project is a **Password Complexity Checker** built in Python that evaluates the **strength and security** of user passwords.  
It analyzes the password based on multiple parameters such as **length**, **uppercase and lowercase letters**, **numbers**, and **special characters** to determine how secure the password is.  

The program provides instant feedback and categorizes passwords as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**, helping users create safer and more reliable passwords.

### ⚙️ Working Principle  
1. The user enters a password in the program.  
2. The tool checks for:  
   - ✅ Minimum length (8+ characters)  
   - 🔠 Uppercase and lowercase letters  
   - 🔢 Numerical digits  
   - 🔣 Special characters (like @, #, $, %)  
3. Based on these conditions, it calculates a **complexity score** and provides feedback on password strength.

4. ### 💡 Features  
- Analyzes password strength using multiple criteria.  
- Provides detailed feedback and improvement tips.  
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.  
- Can be extended with a GUI for real-time password strength checking.

**Example **
Enter password: Snehal@123
✅ Contains uppercase letters
✅ Contains lowercase letters
✅ Contains digits
✅ Contains special characters
Password Strength: STRONG 💪
